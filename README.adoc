= boot-gae

A library of boot tasks that makes development of Clojure applications
on Google App Engine ridiculously easy.  Supports interactive
programming - edit your Clojure source and see the result immediately,
by refreshing your webpage, not restarting your app. Replaces and
improves on the maven/gradle build systems provided by Google.

WARNING: GAE Standard Environment does not support Java 1.8 or above.
Be *sure* to build your app with Java 1.7!

[[getting-started]]
=== getting started

Sample code, with extensive documentation, is available at https://github.com/migae/boot-gae-examples[boot-gae-examples].

NOTE: you do not need a GAE account to experiment!  The GAE SDK
contains everything you need to run webapps on the local devserver;
you only need a GAE account if you want to deploy to the production
servers.


WARNING:  The Appengine Standard Environment does not support Java 1.8.  Use 1.7.




[[tasks]]
== tasks

`boot-gae` is a task library comprising 13 tasks.

This allows the user to experiment task by task, which is the best way
to learn how the whole thing works.  It also makes it easier to debug
build pipelines.

Task library documentation: link:doc/tasks.adoc[tasks]

[[configuration]]
= how it works

You configure a boot-gae application by writing a `build.boot` file
and some `edn` files.  For example, you specify servlets in
`servlets.edn`, which looks like this:

[source,clojure]
----
{:servlets [{:ns greetings.hello
             :name "hello-servlet"
             :display {:name "Awesome Hello Servlet"}
             :desc {:text "blah blah"}
             :urls ["/hello/*" "/foo/*"]
             :params [{:name "greeting" :val "Hello"}]
             :load-on-startup {:order 3}}
  ...]}
----

boot-gae tasks will use these files to automate just about everything:

* xml configuration files (web.xml and appengine-web.xml
* servlet and filter stub class files
* a "reloader" filter that supports quasi-REPL responsiveness

NOTE: Currently only the
https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/about-the-standard-environment[Standard
Environment] is supported.  The
https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/[Flexible
Environment] is not supported.

GAE applications can be built as stand-alone, servlet-based apps, or
as a service-based app composed of multiple services.  `boot-gae`
supports both styles.  See the documentation of
https://github.com/migae/boot-gae-examples[boot-gae-examples] for
details.


== configuration

[[dependencies]]
==== dependencies

At a minimum, the `build.boot` file for a GAE webapp must include a
dependency for Clojure, for the Appengine Java SDK, and for boot-gae.
In addition, if you want to use GAE services (e.g. the
https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/java/datastore/[datastore]),
you must include the appropriate API jar. For example:

IMPORTANT: Note that there are two SDKs, an Appengine-Java-SDK and an
Appengine API SDK.  The former should really be called something like
"dev tools SDK", because it's a zip file containing the stuff you need
to run the devserver, local service stubs for testing etc.  Your
production app code will not use it, so it does not get uploaded on
deploy.  The API SDK, by contrast, contains the libraries you need to
use GAE services like memcache and datastore.  If your app does not
use any services (e.g. it just serves static pages) you don't need it.

WARNING: The GAE java SDK is in the vicinity of 200 MB as of version
1.9.37, so the first time you run `boot` with that as a dependency it
may take a _long_ time (like 5-10 minutes or more depending on your
network connection etc.)  Currently `boot` does not have a download
progress indicator, so it may appear to hang.  You can monitor
progress by running `$ boot -vv help` .


[source,clojure]
.build.boot
----
 :dependencies '[[org.clojure/clojure "1.8.0" :scope "runtime"]
 	         [javax.servlet/servlet-api "2.5" :scope "provided"]
 	         [migae/boot-gae "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT" :scope "test"]
          	 ;; this is for the GAE runtime (NB: scope provided)
	         [com.google.appengine/appengine-java-sdk LATEST :scope "provided" :extension "zip"]
		 ;; OPTIONAL:
		 ;; this is for GAE services, e.g. datastore (NB: scope runtime)
		 ;; [com.google.appengine/appengine-api-1.0-sdk LATEST :scope "runtime"]
          	 ;; this is required for gae appstats:
                 ;; [com.google.appengine/appengine-api-labs LATEST :scope "provided"]
	         ...]
----

NOTE: Google
https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/java/tools/appstats[Appstats
for Java] depends on the memcache service, so to use it you must
include both the API SDK and the API LABS dependencies.

The purpose of the GAE Java SDK dependency is just to make sure it
gets downloaded (its enormous so it takes a long time).  The
`install-sdk` task will explode the downloaded zip file to `:sdk-root`
(default: `~/.appengine`), and at runtime the devserver will look
there for the jars it needs.

NOTE: The java sdk is not used by app code, it's just there for the
devserver and test service stubs, so it should have :scope provided
even though it will not in fact be provided by the prod env.

WARNING: Including the API jar may result in a dramatic increase in
servlet startup time on the dev server.  You can fix this by running
the devserver without the default `javaagent`.  This improves startup
time, but at the cost of the security checks performed by the default
agent `appengine-agent.jar` (included in the SDK).  See the
link:tasklib/README.adoc#run[run] task for details.


[[fileset]]
==== fileset

The initial boot fileset is determined by the `:asset-paths`,
`:resource-paths`, and `:source-paths` keys in the `set-env!`
directive in `build.boot`.  See
https://github.com/boot-clj/boot/wiki/Boot-Environment[Boot
Environment] and
https://github.com/boot-clj/boot/wiki/Filesets[Filesets] on the boot
wiki for details.

The important thing to understand is that putting directories in these
lists causes the files they contain to be added to the initial fileset,
and marks them with INPUT and OUTPUT flags (boot calls these "roles",
see https://github.com/boot-clj/boot/wiki/Filesets[Filesets]) as follows:

* :asset-paths:     [-INPUT,+OUTPUT]
* :resource-paths:  [+INPUT,+OUTPUT]
* :source-paths:    [+INPUT,-OUTPUT]

A detailed explanation of how `boot` works is beyond the scope of this
document, but at a minimum you need to know that only files marked
+OUTPUT will be written out to the target directory by the built-in
https://github.com/boot-clj/boot/blob/master/doc/boot.task.built-in.md#target[target]
task; files marked with â€‘OUTPUT (i.e. files found in `:source-paths`) will
not be written out.  You can see this in action by running

[source,shell]
----
$ boot show -f target
----

in any directory containing a `build.boot` file.  The `show -f` task
will print all the files in the initial fileset (although it will not
indicate their INPUT/OUTPUT "roles"), and the `target` task will write
the +OUTPUT files to the output directory ("target/" by default).  So
if you put e.g. `src/clj` in the `:source-paths` list, they will *not*
be copied to the output directory.  The implicit assumption is that
source files are there to be transformed (compiled).  If you want
source files to be copied rather than transformed, you can use the
https://github.com/boot-clj/boot/blob/master/doc/boot.task.built-in.md#sift[sift]
task.  `boot-gae` handles this sort of thing automatically, so you
should put your Clojure source files in `:source-paths`.

Similarly, the implicit assumption with respect to files in
`:asset-paths` and `:resource-paths` is that the former are there to
be copied to the output directory without transformation, and the
latter are there to be copied to the output directory and _possibly_
transformed.

However, `boot` tasks have to power to finesse things; they can move
files to and from these "roles", for example.  Some `boot-gae` tasks
do this.

With the above in mind here's how `boot-gae` tasks treat the fileset:

* the files in `:asset-paths` will be copied directly to `target/`
  (the default output directory); `boot-gae` tasks do not move or
  transform these files.  The example apps put `resources/public` in
  `:asset-paths`; this puts everything in that source directory at the
  top level of the webapp "context".  _You do not need to put a
  `WEB-INF` directory in_ `resources/public`!  That directory will be
  automatically created and added to the fileset by `boot-gae` tasks
  as appropriate.

 ** however, you _may_ have a `resources/public/WEB-INF` directory; for
  example, you would do this if you want to include a `queue.xml` file
  to configure GAE task queues: `resources/public/WEB-INF/queue.xml`
  would then be copied directly to `target/WEB-INF/queue.xml`.

* `:resource-paths` should contain the Clojure source files you want
  to copy to `target/` without aot-compilation.  `boot-gae` will take
  care of moving them to `WEB-INF/classes`.

* `:source-paths` should contain any source code you need to compile
  (Java files, Clojure files to be aot-compiled), plus your `boot-gae`
  configuration `.edn` files.

==== xml config files

GAE webapps require at least two XML configuration files,
`WEB-INF/web.xml` and `WEB-INF/appengine-web.xml`.  The former
configures your webapp; the latter configures appengine.

* https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/java/config/webxml[The Deployment Descriptor: web.xml]
* https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/java/config/appconfig[Configuring appengine-web.xml]

`boot-gae` generates these files automatically from `.edn` files.

Your app may also include several other XML configuration files,
depending on which GAE facilities you use:

* https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/java/config/indexconfig[WEB-INF/datastore-indexes.xml]
* https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/java/config/cron[WEB-INF/cron.xml]
* https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/java/config/queue[WEB-INF/queue.xml]
* https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/java/how-requests-are-routed#routing_with_a_dispatch_file[WEB-INF/dispatch.xml]

See also https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/java/xml-configuration-files[Organizing xml Configuration Files].


`boot-gae` does not currently provide any direct support for these
files; to use them, create them in your `:resource-paths`, e.g.

IMPORTANT: You could also use yaml files to configure a GAE webapp;
see
https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/java/yaml-configuration-files[Organizing
yaml Configuration Files].  Since we have `edn` we don't need no
stinkin' yaml or xml!  `boot-gae` uses no yaml files, but does not
stop you from including them in your `:asset-paths`.


[[edn]]
==== edn config files

[,]
""
XML files!? We don' need no stinkin XML files!
""


[[reloading]]
==== reloading
The dev server will automatically reload `appengine-web.xml` if it
changes, but unfortunately the same cannot be said for `web.xml`. If
you change it - that is, if you make changes to your configuration
files that would changes `web.xml` you'll need to rebuild the app and
reboot the devserver.


[[foolets]]

== filters and servlets


[[filters]]
=== filters

Note that the sample apps put filter source code in `filters/`
rather than `src/clj/`, and add that path to the `:resource-paths`
list in `build.boot`.  So e.g. `filters/hello_filter.clj` will be
copied to `target/WEB-INF/classes/hello_filter.clj`.  This makes the
namespaces single-level, e.g. `filters/hello_filter.clj` has namespace
`hello-filter`, not `filters/hello-filter`.

The class file corresponding to this implementation file must be
configured in `filters.edn`, which the sample code puts in `config/`,
which is put in `:source-paths`.

You don't have to follow this convention; I use it just because I
prefer to treat filters as separate from application code and have
them at the root of the `classes` hierarcy..

[[servlets]]
=== servlets


The App Engine functions as a servlet container (it's actually a
modified version of Jetty).  Servlet containers look on disk for
compiled byte code when they need to load a servlet.  That means a
Clojure webapp must aot-compile a servlet; usually this is done using
`gen-class` in some form.

You will notice that `gen-class` is nowhere to be found the Clojure
source code of this app.  That's because it depends on the `boot-gae`
task library, which contains a `servlets` task that uses data in the
`servlets.edn` config file to generate the appropriate `gen-class` code and
aot-compiles it at build time.  You only have to do that once, unless
you change the servlet configuration in `build.boot`.

The generated code looks like the following:

[source,clojure]
----
;; TRANSIENT SERVLET GENERATOR
;; DO NOT EDIT - GENERATED BY servlets TASK
(ns servletsgen2293)

(gen-class :name greetings.hello
           :extends javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet
           :impl-ns greetings.hello)

(gen-class :name greetings.goodbye
           :extends javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet
           :impl-ns greetings.goodbye)
----

By default, this code is not retained; once the AOT compile is
finished, this source code is discarded.  You can modify this by
passing `-k` (keep) to the `servlets` task.

Note that the generated class extends
https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.5-doc/servletapi/javax/servlet/http/HttpServlet.html[HttpServlet],
which is an abstract class. You will have to implement at least one of
its methods.  The example uses the `defservice` macro of the
https://ring-clojure.github.io/ring/ring.util.servlet.html[ring.util.servlet]
component of https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring[ring]. That macro
creates a `-service` function in the implementation namespace.  When
the Servlet Container invokes the `service` method of the AOT-compiled
servlet, the generated code will forward the call to the `-service`
function.

IMPORTANT:  The key to understanding how this all works is in the documentation of `gen-class`:

.gen-class
****
...
The gen-class construct contains no implementation, as the
implementation will be dynamically sought by the generated class in
functions in an implementing Clojure namespace. Given a generated
class org.mydomain.MyClass with a method named mymethod, gen-class
will generate an implementation that looks for a function named by
(str prefix mymethod) (default prefix: "-") in a Clojure namespace
specified by :impl-ns (defaults to the current namespace).
...
****

WARNING: Note that if you want to implement one of the other
`HttpServlet` methods, like `doGet`, your function name must include
an initial `-`, e.g. `-doGet`, not `doGet`.  (I think...)

This is of course not the only possible technique we could use to
implement servlets in Clojure.  `boot-gae` could easily be extended to
suppport alternative mechanisms, but this one seems to work pretty
well.

The servlet specifications in `servlets.edn` are also used (by the
`webxml` task) to generate the `web.xml` configuration file needed by
the servlet container.

WARNING: The `webxml` task uses the information in `servlets.edn`, but
does not read that file directly.  Instead the data from
`servlets.edn` are added to the (hidden) edn file that is passed from
task to task, and `webxml` uses that file.  So the `webxml` task must
be executed *after* the `servlets` task.


[[logging]]
== logging

Log levels are a little tricky.  GAE uses two kinds of log, "Request
Logs" and "Application Logs".

The documentation says: "A request log is automatically written by App
Engine for each request handled by your app... Each request log
contains a list of application logs (AppLogLine) associated with that
request..."

This makes sense, since any logging your webapp does will always be
associated with a particular request.

Applications can log to the standard JUL levels (SEVERE, WARNING,
INFO, CONFIG, FINE, FINER, and FINEST); however, the log levels used
for AppLogLines are DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, and FATAL.  Obviously
this means that the GAE Request Log system must map the former to the
latter in some manner, but I have not found any documentation on this.

The following table shows the various log levels involved:

.Log Levels
|===
| Clojure tools.logging | log4j | java.util.logging | AppLogLine
| :trace | TRACE | N/A | N/A

| :debug | DEBUG | FINE? | DEBUG

| :info | INFO | INFO, CONFIG? | INFO

| :warn | WARN | WARNING | WARN

| :error | ERROR | SEVERE? | ERROR

| :fatal | FATAL | SEVERE? | FATAL

| | OFF |
|===

The mapping from the log4j-based levels used by clojure.tools.logging
to the JUL-based levels used by GAE is not entirely clear to me.
You'll have to experiment.

If you use JUL logging, then you'll use `WEB-INF/logging.properties`,
and in that file you'll have to set the logging level to one of the
JUL levels, e.g. TRACE won't work, since it's not a JUL level.

If you want to use log4j (or slf4j, etc.), then ...

==== log4j2

"Apache Log4j 2 is an upgrade to Log4j that provides significant
improvements over its predecessor, Log4j 1.x,..."

[[performance]]
== performance

If devserver startup is preposterously slow pass the
`--no-java-agent` flag to the `run` task.

[[testing]]
== testing

==== devserver

You'll use the dev server from the SDK to test locally.  Running `$
boot gae/run` gives:

[source,shell]
----
Executing
	[/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_66.jdk/Contents/Home/jre/bin/java,
	-XstartOnFirstThread,
	-javaagent:/Users/gar/.appengine-sdk/appengine-java-sdk-1.9.34/lib/agent/appengine-agent.jar,
	-Xbootclasspath/p:/Users/gar/.appengine-sdk/appengine-java-sdk-1.9.34/lib/override/appengine-dev-jdk-overrides.jar,

	--sdk_root=/Users/gar/.appengine-sdk/appengine-java-sdk-1.9.34,
	 /Users/gar/boot/boot-gae/modules/greetings/target]
----

Notice that the classpath is empty.  The dev server runs in its own
JVM, and sets the classpath to include only the SDK jars needed plus
the jars in `WEB-INF/lib`, plus the files in `WEB-INF/classes`.

==== service stubs

https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/java/tools/localunittesting[Local Unit Testing for Java]

To run tests using GAE services like memcache and datastore, add the
following dependencies, scoped to "test", to your `build.boot`:

[source,clojure]
----
    [com.google.appengine/appengine-api-1.0-sdk LATEST :scope "test"]
    [com.google.appengine/appengine-api-labs LATEST :scope "test"]
    [com.google.appengine/appengine-api-stubs LATEST :scope "test"]
    [com.google.appengine/appengine-tools-sdk LATEST :scope "test"]
----

IMPORTANT: The online documentation mentions that you need
`${SDK_ROOT}/lib/impl/appengine-api.jar` on your classpath.  This jar
is included in the SDK but is not separately available as a maven
artifact.  However, maven artifact
`com.google.appengine/appengine-api-1.0-sdk` is the same thing,
versioned.



[[app-id]]
=== app id and version

A GAE webapp requires an app id and version.  Your source project will
have a project name and version.  You must specify these separately in
your `build.boot` file.  The app id will probably be different than
the project name, since the latter may be namespaced, and a GAE app id
must follow a different grammar.  You set the app id when you register
your app in Google's Cloud Platform console.  Your project version
will most likely conform to Clojure standard practice, something like
`0.1.0`, or `0.1.0-SNAPSHOT`.  GAE version strings must conform to a
fairly restrictive grammar: "The version identifier can contain
lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens. It cannot begin with the
prefix "ah-" and the names "default" and "latest" are reserved and
cannot be used."

You can use Clojure version strings for your app version.  `boot-gae`
will lowercase it, translate "." to "-", and since "-SNAPSHOT" is for
source code rather than running apps, it will be stripped from the
version string.

Furthermore, Google recommends that version strings begin with a
lowercase letter, to make sure that version strings are not confused
with instance numbers. (See
https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/java/config/appconfig#Java_appengine_web_xml_About_appengine_web_xml[About
appengine-web.xml]).  So `boot-gae` will prepend "r" to your
version string.

For example, if your project version string is `0.1.0-SNAPSHOT`, then
your gae app version string will be `r-0-1-0`.



[[deployment]]
=== deployment


* Make sure you do a production build, `boot gae/build -p gae/target`.
  This ensures that the `reloader` filter will be omitted.

* Make sure the `<module>` element in `appengine-web.xml` is
  correctly set.  For a standalone webapp, it should be omitted or set
  to `<module>default</module>`.  To arrange for this, set the `:gae`
  stanza in your `build.boot` accordingly:

[source,clojure]
----
(set-env!
 :gae {:app-id "boot-gae-greetings"
       :module {:name "default"}  ;; or delete this line
       :version +version+}
...
----

*   For a microservices app, each
  service should have a `<module>` element; the first service listed
  will be the default service.

* Run `gae/deployment`


[[services]]
= microservices

See https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/java/an-overview-of-app-engine[Services: The building blocks of App Engine].

Naming and versioning of services is a bit mysterious.

Each service will end up as an exploded war directory in the ear
directory.  _The name of the war dir is determined by the `<web-uri>`
element in the `META-INF/application.xml` file in the ear source tree_.

GAE allows you to run multiple versions of each service.  Each
service+version should have a unique name.  You set the name of each
service in its `WEB-INF/appengine-web.xml`, in the `<module>` element.
Note that that `<application>` element of that file is ignored (since
it is a service in an app rather than an app itself).  Not sure about
the `<version>` element.

The name set in `<module>` will be used at runtime to construct the
URL at which the service is accessible.  For example,
`<module>foo</module>` of app `myapp` will be accessible at
`http://foo.myapp.appspot.com`.

But that module name is _not_ used at build time.  The
`META-INF/application.xml` file, which controls the structure of the
app, does not refer to the service name set in each service's
`WEB-INF/appengine-web.xml` file.  Instead, the root directory of each
service is referenced, in a `<module>` element.  For example:

[source,xml]
----
  <module>
    <web>
      <web-uri>appengine-modules-shardedcounter-1.0</web-uri>
      <context-root>appengine-modules-shardedcounter</context-root>
    </web>
  </module>
----

WARNING: "App Engine will ignore the <context-root> elements, so HTTP
clients need not prepend it to the URL path when addressing a module."

But if `application.xml` does not reference the services, how does the
final build product get built?  How does the build system know what to
put in the ear, and what to name it?

Different build systems do it differently.  The (outdated) maven
system appended the version string and ".war" to the maven
artifact id.  The gradle system uses the service name from
`settings.gradle` to name the wardir path in `build/exploded-app`; if
the gradle build file specifies a version, that will be appended to
the service name.  The `<web-uri>` element in `application.xml` must
then match the constructed service name.

Here's how `boot-gae` does it.  The service name must be specified in
the `:gae` stanza of the `build.boot` file for each service using the
`:gae :module :name` key.  That name will be used for:

* the value of `<module>` in `appengine-web.xml` for each service
* the name of the target dir in each service's project tree
* the name of the war dir in the ear target output dir
* the value of `<web-uri>` in the ear `META-INF/application.xml`

*TODO* explain boot.build for the ear directory.

You could probably use something like

If you know what you're doing you can use Java debugging facilities to
remotely debug the dev server.  For example:

`$ boot gae/run --jvm-flags "-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,address=7000"`

I have no idea how to use this to debug clojure code, but if you're
dying to know how the dev server works you can use this to step
through its startup code, at least.


[[troubleshooting]]
== troubleshooting

* `clojure.lang.ExceptionInfo: Map literal must contain an even number of forms`

This means one of your edn config files is malformed.

=== building

==== deployment


* If you have created the app project in your account (either via the
  web console or the gcloud CLI), but you still get an error saying
  the project does not exist, then the deploy tool probably thinks you
  are logged in to a different account.  Just delete
  `~/.appcfg_oauth2_tokens_java` and try again.

* You get an error like: `POST /hello HTTP/1.1" 200 92 -
  "Apache-HttpClient/UNAVAILABLE (Java/1.8.0_112)"`. This means you
  used Java 1.8 to build your app. You must use 1.7 or lower.

[[todo]]
=== todo

* a note about Std v. Flexible environments

* note:  "modules" are now called "services" in the official docs.

* split servlet/filter configs into separate files, e.g. `servlets/foo.edn`

* cherry-picking servlets and filters for building

* support for android/gradle-style build variants and flavors

* multiple configs for same servlet - e.g. for experimenting with
  various initialization parameters, etc.

* full Clojure (e.g. ring/compojure) support for filters.  i.e. treat
  them the same way we treat servlets, provide a `deffilter` macro etc.

* support some kind of threading syntax for filter config?  currently
  the filter chain is implicitly defined by the order in which the
  filter specs occur.  this is in contrast with servlet configs, where
  text order makes no difference (for most purposes?).  It would be
  nice to make the filter chain explicity using std Clojure
  operations, e.g. `(-> request filter-a filter-b ...)` But maybe that would
  be overkill; vectors are already ordered.

* note that servlet filters behave exactly like ring handlers (or
  vice-versa), which is exactly like a boot pipeline.
