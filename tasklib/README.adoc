= boot-gae

A Boot library for Google App Engine development in Clojure.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This documentation is a little bit out of date, and, like the code, is
unpolished and partially incomplete.  In particular the reader will
probably need to have some idea of how boot works.
====

IMPORTANT: not yet pushed to clojars.  If you want to give it a try,
you must fork/clone it and run `$ boot pom jar install` to put it in
your local repo.

IMPORTANT: you do not need a GAE account to experiment!  The GAE SDK
contains everything you need to run webapps on the local devserver;
you only need a GAE account if you want to deploy to the production
servers.

[[start]]
= getting started

Currently, `boot-gae` is not on clojars.  You'll have to fork/clone
the repo.  It contains `tasklib`, the task lib itself, and
`greetings-gae`, a test/demo program that uses the tasklib.

[NOTE]
====
This documentation will use the namespace alias `gae`, as just shown,
to refer to boot-gae tasks.  For example, `gae/config` means `migae.boot-gae/config`.
====


Then you need to configure your web app.  See the sample app, `config`
directory, for examples.  Doc to come...


[[configuration]]
== configuration

Both the `WEB-INF/appengine-web.xml` and `WEB-INF/web.xml`
configuration files required by the GAE servlet container are
automatically generated from `.edn` files.

The dev server will automatically reload `appengine-web.xml` if it
changes, but unfortunately the same cannot be said for `web.xml`. If
you change it - that is, if you change your configuration files you'll
need to rebuild and restart the server.


[[tasks]]
= tasks

* `<<appengine>>` generate gae `appengine-web.xml` config file
* `<<webxml>>`    generate gae `web.xml` config file
* `<<deploy>>`             install a new version of the application onto the server
* `<<dev>>`                build for dev (includes `reloader` task)
* `<<filters>>`            generate a "meta-filter" file with gen-class directives and aot-compile it to generate filters
* `<<install-sdk>>`        unpack and install the SDK zipfile
* `<<libs>>`               install dependency jars in <build-dir>/WEB-INF/lib
* `<<logging>>`		   generate and install gae logging config files (e.g. `logging.properties`, `log4j.properties`)
* `<<prod>>`		   build for production (without `reloader` task)
* `<<reloader>>`	   generate and aot-compile reloader filter used to support reload-on-refresh
* `<<run>>`		   run devappserver
* `<<servlets>>`	   generate a "meta-servlet" file with gen-class directives and aot-compile it to produce servlets
* `<<watch>>`		   watch input, write to output on change


==== aot

The builtin `aot` command does not allow specification of output dir so we hacked it up

[[config-appengine]]
==== appengine

Generates `WEB-INF/appengine-web.xml` from `appengine.edn`

==== appstats

Enables Google's built-in Appstats service.  Configure in `appstats.edn`

==== clj

Move clojure source files to `WEB-INF/classes`

[[deploy]]
=== deploy

You will obviously need a GAE account to deploy.

To deploy run `$ boot gae/deploy`.

[[dev]]
=== dev

The build pipeline:

[source,clojure]
----
  (comp (install-sdk)
        (libs)
        (logging)
        (clj)
        (appstats)
        (filters :keep keep)
        (servlets :keep keep)
        (reloader :keep keep)
        (webxml)
        (appengine)
        ))
----

Some of the tasks can be run in any order (e.g. filters and servlets) but `webxml` must be run after `servlets`, `filters`, `appstats` and `reloader`, since it uses the `web.xml.edn` file they elaborate.  The `reloader` ``filters`, and `appstats` tasks are optional.

[[filters]]
=== filters

[[install-sdk]]
=== install-sdk

[[libs]]
=== libs

Copy all dependency jars to `WEB-INF/lib`, required by Appengine.

[[logging]]
=== logging

[[reloader]]
=== reloader

Install a servlet filter to support reload-on-refresh in conjunction
with the `watch` task.  For use during development, in order to get
repl-like responsiveness.  Run `gae/reloader -k` to see the intermediate files.

[[run]]
=== run

==== security

Add security-constraint stanzas to `web.xml`.  Configuration data goes in `security.edn`.

WARNING: not yet implemented


[[servlets]]
=== servlets

Servlets can be implemented in Clojure in a variety of ways; boot-gae
supports the technique described here out of the box, via the
`gae/servlets` task.  That task reads the `gae` configuration map from
`build.boot`, processes a stencil template file to generate a Clojure
source file, and then aot compiles that source file.

WARNING: the following config example is obsolete - boot-gae now uses
`.edn` files for configuration.  But the processing is pretty much as
described here.  See the `greetings-gae` test app for examples.  Try
running `gae/servlets` with and without the `:keep` flag to see the
intermediate files.

NOTE: Tasks like `filters`, `servlets`, and `reloader` work by
elaborating `web.xml.edn`.  They don't actually produce output; that's
the job of the `webxml` task that uses the `web.xml.edn` config info
to generate the actual `WEB-INF/web.xml` file.

Here's an example:  this configuration map:

[source,clojure]
.build.boot
----
(def gae
{ ...
   :servlet-ns 'migae.servlets
   :servlets [{:ns 'migae.echo  ;; = servlet-class
               ;; :jsp - alternative to :ns, for using java servlet pages
               :name "echo-servlet"
               :display {:name "Awesome Echo Servlet"}
               :desc {:text "blah blah"}
               :url "/echo/*"
               :params [{:name "greeting" :val "Hello"}]
               :load-on-startup {:order 3}}

              {:ns 'migae.math      ;; REQUIRED
               :name "math-servlet"  ;; REQUIRED
               :url "/math/*"      ;; REQUIRED
               :params [{:name "op" :val "+"}
                        {:name "arg1" :val 3}
                        {:name "arg2" :val 2}]}]
...}
----

will produce the following Clojure:

[source,clojure]
.migae/servlets.clj
----
(ns migae.servlets)

(gen-class :name migae.echo
           :extends javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet
           :impl-ns migae.echo)
(gen-class :name migae.math
           :extends javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet
           :impl-ns migae.math)

(gen-class :name migae.reloader
           :implements [javax.servlet.Filter]
           :impl-ns migae.reloader)
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
The namespace for this file is specified by the `:servlet-ns` key of
the `gae` config map, and the gen-class `:name` and `:impl-ns` values
are from the `:servlets` key.  See the <<config-map,example>> below.

Note that `:servlets-ns` is a little misleading; the generated file is
not itself a servlet, it's just there to hold the `gen-class`
operations that generate the actual servlet code.
====

[TIP]
====

By default the generated clojure file will be discarded once it has been aot compiled.  To save it, add the
====

Servlet implementations will look like this:

        echo-routes)
       (wrap-defaults api-defaults)
       ))
----



[[watch]]
=== watch

[[webxml]]
==== webxml

Generates `WEB-INF/web.xml` from `web.xml.edn`.  Run this task *after*
you run `servlets`, `filters`, `reloader`, and `appstats`.


[[repl]]
= replry

WARNING: This section is somewhat out of date.  Now the tasks
`gae/watch` and `gae/reloader` together give you the technique
described below out of the box.

Then you'll need to prepare things, as described below.  Once that's
done, you'll no doubt want to do repl-based development: change some
source code and have the results show up immediately in the browser.
We're not quite that replish: you have to refresh the browser.  To
make this work, you have to copy your changes into `WEB-INF/classes`.
That's because the GAE dev server will refuse to look anywhere else
for resources, for security reasons.

So if you want repl, you need to do two things. First, run the
following command before you start editing:

```
$ boot watch sift -i "clj$" target -d "build/WEB-INF/classes" -C
```

Now when a source file changes, `sift -i "clj$"` will exclude anything
not matching the include regex "clj$" and pass the result to `target`,
which will move everthing into the classpath.

[WARNING]
====
If you're going to be working with multiple file types you'll need to adjust the regex and/or run multiple watch pipelines.

For example, if you want to edit .css files located at <approot> (that
is, not in WEB-INF), you would run something like: 

```
$ boot watch sift -i "html$" target -d "build" -C
```
====


WARNING: obsolete.  you don't have to do this by hand any more, the
`reloader` task handles it automatically.

The second thing you need to do is install a filter servlet that will
reload your Clojure files from `WEB-INF/classes`.  Here's an example:

[source,clojure]
.build.boot
----
(def gae
 {...
   :filters [{:ns 'migae.reloader   ; REQUIRED
              :name "reloader"      ; REQUIRED
              :display {:name "Clojure reload filter"} ; OPTIONAL
              :urls [{:url "/echo/*"}
                     {:url "/math/*"}]
              :desc {:text "clojure reload filter"}}]
  ...}
----

[source,clojure]
.migae/servlets.clj
----
;; DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE
;; autogenned from build.boot and template
(ns migae.servlets)
...
(gen-class :name migae.reloader
           :implements [javax.servlet.Filter]
           :impl-ns migae.reloader)
----

[source,clojure]
.migae/reloader.clj
----
(ns migae.reloader
  (:import (javax.servlet Filter FilterChain FilterConfig
                          ServletRequest ServletResponse))
  (:require [ns-tracker.core :refer :all]))
(defn -init [^Filter this ^FilterConfig cfg])
(defn -destroy [^Filter this])
(def modified-namespaces (ns-tracker ["./"]))
(defn -doFilter
  [^Filter this
   ^ServletRequest rqst
   ^ServletResponse resp
   ^FilterChain chain]
  (doseq [ns-sym (modified-namespaces)]
    (require ns-sym :reload))
  (.doFilter chain rqst resp))
----

[source,xml]
.WEB-INF/web.xml
----
  <filter-mapping>
    <url-pattern>/echo/*</url-pattern>
    <filter-name>reloader</filter-name>
  </filter-mapping>
  <filter-mapping>
    <url-pattern>/math/*</url-pattern>
    <filter-name>reloader</filter-name>
  </filter-mapping>
  <filter>
    <filter-name>reloader</filter-name>
    <filter-class>migae.reloader</filter-class>
  </filter>
----

To make this work, all you need to provide is the `migae/reloader.clj`
file and set the configuration map.  The `WEB-INF/web.xml` file will
be autogenned as explained in <<config>>, and the
`migae/servlets.clj` file will be autogenned, aot-compiled, and
discarded, as explained in <<servlets>>.

[[how]]
== how it works
Once your `build.boot` is set up, you need to prepared the system.
boot-gae has a dependency on the GAE sdk, so the first time you run it
it will be downloaded.  Don't be alarmed if it takes a while; the SDK
is a ~165 MB zipfile.

The GAE dev server requires that the SDK be available in exploded
form.  The maven artifact that gets installed into `~/.m2/repository`
is a zipfile; the `gae/install-sdk` task will explode it and install
it.

Use the `:sdk-root` key in the `gae` configuration map to specify a
location.  The default is `~/.appengine-sdk`; if you want to be
compatible with Gradle, use `:sdk-root "~/.gradle/appengine-sdk".

Once the SDK is installed, proceed with preparing your webapp.  GAE
has strict security rules; the dev server will not allow access to
anything outside of the webapp's root directory.  That means that
everything that needs to be on the classpath must be installed in
`<approot>/WEB-INF`.  For libraries that means all the jarfile
dependencies must be copied into `<approot>/WEB-INF/lib`.  The
`gae/libs` task takes care of this:

```
$ boot gae/libs
Adding uberjar entries...
Sifting output files...
Writing target dir(s)...
```

Now you have four tasks remaining:

* copy sources/resources into the build tree so they will be accessible by the dev server
* configure logging - `gae/logging`; configuration is set via the `:logging` key in the config map
* configure appengine and the servlet container (create appengine-web.xml and web.xml)
 ** <<config>> will read the <<config-map,configuration map>> and generate these files
* aot compile your servlets - <<servlets>> does this.

[WARNING]
====
The way boot works is that the `target` task will copy stuff to the
build directory.  So for example, if you have `foo.html` at the root
of your resources dir, `target` will put it in the same place
*relative to the build dir*, so it will end up in `<build-dir>/`.  For
static assets that's generally a good thing.

For Clojure files, and for anything that you want to move into
`WEB-INF` (thereby removing it from public accessibility), you need to
use the `sift` task instead.  In particular the `:move` parameter to
`sift` allows you to pick out the files you are interested in and rewrite
their paths.

You could use `sift` to arrange things by hand, but as a convenience
the `gae/clj` task will do it for you.


[[config-map]]
== configuration map

WARNING: Waaaay obsolete.  We now use `.edn` config files.  But the
map structure is pretty much the same.  See the sample app
`greetings-gae` for examples.

The configuration map is used by the `gae/config` task to generate the
`web.xml` and `appengine-web.xml` files required by GAE.

It is also used by the `gae/servlets` task, which generates and aot
compiles the Clojure code needed to support servlet development; see
<<servlets>> for details.

== gae programming with clojure

You know about the https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/java/jrewhitelist[whitelist].  Did you notice the fine print?

NOTE: Just because a class is whitelisted doesn't mean that all the
features and operations of the class are supported for an app running
in the App Engine sandbox environment.

For example, this will fail with an access exception:

[source,clojure]
----
(let [fac (javax.xml.stream.XMLInputFactory/newFactory)
      sr (java.io.StringReader "foo")
      xmlsreader (.createXMLStreamReader fac sr)]
----

That's because this call to `.createXMLStreamReader` cannot be
resolved at compile time, so at runtime Clojure will try to use
reflection to invoke the method.  The involves a call to `getMethods`
that GAE disallows.

To fix this you need to provide a type hint so that Clojure can
resolve the call at compile time:

`(.createXMLStreamReader fac ^StringReader sr)`
